# Multiple Datacenters

## ServiceCenter Aggregate Architecture

Now, service center has supported multiple datacenters deployment. 
Its architecture likes below.

```eval_rst
.. image:: multidcs.PNG
```

As shown in the figure, we deploy an SC(Service-Center) cluster independently under each DC(datacenter).
Each SC cluster manages the micro-service instances under the DC under which it belongs, and the DCs are
isolated from each other. Another implementation of the discovery plug-in, `Service-Center Aggregate` service, can
access multiple SC instances and periodically pull up micro-service instance information so that if some
micro-services can request aggregate, cross-DCs can be implemented using the same API as SC cluster.

If SC aggregate is not deployed globally, SC also supports another way to implement multiple DCs discovery,
as shown below.

```eval_rst
.. image:: multidcs2.PNG
```

The difference between the two approaches is that global deployment aggregate can divert service discovery traffic,
the whole architecture is more like a read-write separation architecture, and the SC of each DC manage microservice
information independently, which reduces the complexity. So we recommend the first architecture.

## Quick Start

Let's assume you want to install 2 clusters of Service-Center in different DCs with following details.

| Cluster | Datacenter  | Address     |  
| :-----: | :---------: | :---------: |  
| sc-1    | dc-1        | 10.12.0.1   |   
| sc-2    | dc-2        | 10.12.0.2   | 

you can follow [this](../user-guides/sc-cluster.md) guide to install Service-Center in cluster mode. After that,
we can deploy a Service-Center Aggregate service now. 

##### Start Service-Center Aggregate

Edit the configuration of the ip/port on which SC aggregate will run, we assume you launch it at 10.12.0.3.
```bash
vi conf/app.conf
# Replace the below values
httpaddr = 10.12.0.3
discovery_plugin = servicecenter
registry_plugin = buildin
self_register = 0
manager_cluster = "sc-1=http://10.12.0.1:30100,sc-2=http://10.12.0.2:30100"

# Start the Service-center
./service-center
```

Note: Please don't run start.sh as it will also start the etcd.

##### Confirm the service is OK

We recommend that you use [`scctl`](../intro/scctl.md), and using
[`cluster command`](https://github.com/apache/servicecomb-service-center/blob/master/scctl/pkg/plugin/README.md#cluster-options)
which makes it very convenient to verify OK.

```bash
scctl --addr http://10.12.0.3:30100 get cluster
#   CLUSTER |        ENDPOINTS         
# +---------+-------------------------+
#   sc-1    | http://10.12.0.1:30100  
#   sc-2    | http://10.12.0.2:30100
```

## Example

Here we show a `golang` example of multiple datacenters access, where we use an 
[example](https://github.com/go-chassis/go-chassis/tree/master/examples/discovery)
of the [go-chassis](https://github.com/go-chassis/go-chassis) project, assuming that below.

| Microservice | Datacenter  | Address     |  
| :-----:      | :---------: | :---------: |  
| Client       | dc-1        | 10.12.0.4   |   
| Server       | dc-2        | 10.12.0.5   |

Notes: `go-chassis` application can run perfectly in the above 2 architectures.
If you are using [java-chassis](https://github.com/apache/servicecomb-java-chassis),
there are only support the service center with the second architecture at the moment.
You can ref to [here](multidcs2.md) for more details of the second architecture.

##### Start Server

Edit the configuration of the ip/port on which Server will register.
```
vi examples/discovery/server/conf/chassis.yaml
```
Replace the below values
```yaml
cse:
  service:
    registry:
      type: servicecenter
      address: http://10.12.0.2:30100 # the address of SC in dc-2
```

Run the Server
```bash
go run examples/discovery/server/main.go
```
##### Start Client

Edit the configuration of the ip/port on which Client will register and discover.
```bash
vi examples/discovery/client/conf/chassis.yaml
```
Replace the below values
```yaml
cse:
  service:
    registry:
      registrator:
        type: servicecenter
        address: http://10.12.0.1:30100 # the address of SC in dc-1
      serviceDiscovery:
        type: servicecenter
        address: http://10.12.0.3:30100 # the address of SC Aggregate
```

Run the Client
```bash
go run examples/discovery/client/main.go
```

##### Confirm the multiple datacenters discovery is OK

Since client is not a service, we check its running log.
